                            is properly structured with Predefined Schemas, it is basically used

                            rows but it follows a Standard Schema Definition and can store all

                        What is JWT, and how does it work?

                            JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                            JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.
                            A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized using base64. In the most common serialization format, compact serialization, the JWT looks something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz.

                        How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?

                            NodeJS application is single-threaded. Say, if processing involves request A that takes 10 seconds, it does not mean that a request which comes after this request needs to wait 10 seconds to start processing because NodeJS event loops are only single-threaded. The entire NodeJS architecture is not single-threaded.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                            NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them. EventLoop is the listener for the EventQueue.
                            If NodeJS can process the request without I/O blocking then the event loop would itself process the request and sends the response back to the client by itself. But, it is possible to process multiple requests parallelly using the NodeJS cluster module or worker_threads module.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                            A single instance of Node.js runs in a single thread. If you have a multi-core system then you can utilize every core. Sometimes developer wants to launch a cluster of NodeJS process to take advantage of the multi-core system.
                            The cluster module allows easy creation of child processes that all share the same server ports.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                            If your system has 8 CPU then 8 NodeJS instances will be created and every instance has its own independent event loop. Now NodeJS can process all request parallelly.
                            They are all share same port (PORT 3000) but not state. The master process listens on a port, accepts new connections and distributes them across the workers in a round-robin fashion, with some built-in smarts to avoid overloading a worker process.
